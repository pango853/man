	The first thing to do is to create a reference to the Microsoft Scripting Runtime, which is the DLL that contains the Dictionary (as well as the FileSystemObject).

Navigate down through the list of available references and select Microsoft Scripting Runtime (\Windows\system32\scrrun.dll). Once that's done the Dictionary is available for you to use in your code.
