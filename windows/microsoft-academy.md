### DEVOPS200.1x: Introduction to DevOps Practices and Principles
- Learn
  - DevOps core values, principles and practices
  - How to deploy to IaaS and PaaS environments in Microsoft Azure using ARM templates, Desired State Configuration (DSC) and other deployment tools
  - Build and deploy applications automatically to Dev, Test and Production environments 
  - Continuous learning from production to improve and scale business results. 
  - Unit tests, Integration tests, load tests, UI tests and test driven-development
  - Data retention strategies, exposure control strategies, and hypothesis-driven development.
- Core values
  - the union of people, processes and products to enable CD of value to end users
  - Goal
    Identify failures more quickly
    - 1 way: Shorten the lead time
    - 2 way: Feedback loop
    - 3 way: Expermientation
- principles
  - DevOps Lifecycle
    - DEV: PLAN -> CREATE -> VERIFY -> PACKAGE -> 
    - OPS: RELEASE -> CONFIGURE -> MONITOR -> (PLAN ->)
  - 7 key DevOps practices
    1. Configuration management
    2. Release management
    3. Continuous integration
    4. Continuous deployment
    5. Infrastructure as Code
    6. Test automation
    7. Application performance monitoring
  - DevOps habits
    1. Team autonomy and enterprise alignment
    2. Rigorous management of technical debt
    3. Focus on flow of customer value
    4. Hypothesis-driven development
    5. Evidence gathered in production
    6. Live-site culture
    7. Manage infrastructure as a flexible resource
- practices
  - Build and Release Pipeline
    release pipeline includes
    - continuous integration techniques
    - continuous testing practices
    - application monitoring
    - treating infrastructure and configuration as code, and
    - deploying frequently and automatically
  - BackLog
  - Version Control
  - Testing in DevOps
    - Continuous testing
    - Beta testing and Progressive exposure
- Compliance and Security
  - Compliance
    - ISO 27001, SOC2, FDA, etc.
    - HIPAA
    - CJIS
    - e.x. use Azure KeyVault

    - Slow release: large batches, complicated -> risky, non-monitored
  - Security, fast to remediate than legacy, and more consistent. DevOps as a much better way to defend security bad actors.
- Change Agent for DevOps
  - BAD: "We have to automate our release pipeline."
  - GOOD: "By focusing on our deployment speed, we will have faster time to mitigate issues and faster time to value. Doing this allows us to work in small batches so that we can test for usage and get validated learnings out of every deployment. It's typical that requirements increase business value about one third of the time, decrease business value about one third of the time, and make no difference a third of the time. We want to fail fast on the ineffective two thirds, and do more of the one third that generates improvements. With DevOps, we can work faster to know that we're developing the right features or pivot if necessary. Ultimately, we can improve and adapt based on being constantly informed by data."
