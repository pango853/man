Conclusion

Content Management Systems help developers in rapid development with lots of benefits like third-party themes, plugins & extensions.
Open Source technologies also minimize project Cost with better Security, Scalability & flexibility.
I have only listed down four Content Management Systems, there are many more with great features.
There’s also some .Net CMS with large community support having a plan to move from .Net Framework to .Net Core in future like Umbraco, EPiserver and Sitecore.
