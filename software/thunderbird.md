# Connect to Outlook Exchange server
The ability to connect the Thunderbird email client to an Exchange server is finally possible. Thanks to Zendesk's ExQuilla Thunderbird addon, you can connect Thunderbird to your Exchange 2007 or 2010 server through Exchange Web Services (EWS). The setup just requires the installation of an addon and some knowledge about your server.

I will walk you through the installation of the addon as well as the setup of your Exchange account. I assume you already have Thunderbird installed and running, you have an Exchange account, and your Exchange server is either 2007 or 2010 and uses EWS.


1.Open Thunderbird.
2.Go to Tools | Addons.
3.In the search field, type Exchange.
4.Click the ExQuilla addon.
5.Click Install.
6.Click Restart within Thunderbird.

OR

1.Download the latest version of ExQuilla for your platform (Windows, Linux, or Mac).
2.Open Thunderbird.
3.Go to Tools | Addons.
4.Click the Tools drop-down and select Install From File.
5.Navigate to where you saved the file and select it.
6.Click the Install button (Figure A).
7.After the install completes, restart Thunderbird by clicking Restart Now.

Setting up
1 find out your EWS address — it will be something like https://YOUR_DOMAIN/EWS/Exchange.asmx.
2. Go to Tools | ExQuilla for Microsoft Exchange and then select Add Microsoft Exchange Account.
3. In the first window of the wizard, enter your email address and password, leave Login With Email Address checked, and click Next.
