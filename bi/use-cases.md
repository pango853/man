Hive was initially developed by Facebook in 2007 to help the company handle massive amounts of new data.

- At the time Hive was created, Facebook had a 15TB dataset they needed to work with. A few short years later, that data had grown to 700TB. Their RDBMS data warehouse was taking too long to process daily jobs so the company decided to move their data into the scalable open-source Hadoop.
- The company found that creating MapReduce programs was not easy and was time-consuming for many users. When they created Hive, their vision was to bring familiar database concepts to Hadoop, making it easier for all users to work with. In 2008 Hive was open sourced. Facebook has since used Hive for reporting dashboards and ad-hoc analysis.
