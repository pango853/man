	DataStock
		https://datastock.shop/ (requires registration)
		DataStock is a solution created by our team at PromptCloud, that lets you instantly download clean and ready-to-use datasets from the web. Using these large volume and clean datasets, you can perform analysis, derive insights and also train machine learning algorithms.
	Kaggle Datasets
	UCI – The University of California, Irvine’s Machine Learning Repository, is one of the best places to start for new learners or when you want to run different algorithms and find which one is efficient or even when you want to just try out a new solution. For example, when I was learning how to use Tensorflow in Python, I used the UCI iris database to test out my code. And since it has so many different varieties of data (many of which have been used by scientists to produce research papers), there’s a lot of use cases that you can cover using them.
		https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php
	JobsPikr – JobsPikr is another tool that helps you get datasets (built by our team at PromptCloud). This solution serves only to clients related to the job industry. It helps job boards, recruitment agencies and other job matching applications, gather job listings, sorted and filtered by different factors like location, title, keywords, etc. It is an automated, no-maintenance, ready-to-use feed that can be customized as per your needs. It is updated with fresh data in real-time and hence is one of the favorites of the recruitment industry. It has multiple delivery options such as API, S3 and direct download.
		https://www.jobspikr.com/
	Awesome Public Datasets – Unlike most other sources on this list, this one is a GitHub page. However, I found it while researching on financial data and quite frankly, I have never seen a data repository this big and organized. It has datasets (or links to them), under topics ranging from the Human Genome Diversity Project to the Yelp™ Dataset Challenge. So, in case you have a problem for which you can’t find a dataset, or you are looking for a dataset of a particular kind, you can always look for it in this repository.

		https://www.yelp.com/dataset			Yelp Open Dataset, An all-purpose dataset for learning
	Nature – The world’s top journal is known mainly for the famous research papers that have been published in it. Groundbreaking discoveries like the “Possible Existence of a Neutron” by J. Chadwick have been published in it. But like you might already know by now, where there are research papers and scientific discoveries, there’s bound to be data repositories. Thus, Nature’s repository provides links for multiple data sources that have been used in the past, as well as those that still need wider and deeper explorations.
		https://www.nature.com/sdata/policies/repositories
	CMU Datasets – Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburg, runs some of the best Machine Learning research in the world. Along with that, they are also gathering some of the best data sources around the world, and you can even recommend them new sources or provide them with data sets that you might have mined or collected on your own. You can learn more about the datasets they are using here.
		https://guides.library.cmu.edu/machine-learning/datasets
	Data.gov – It is described as the home for most of the U.S. Government’s open data. You would not just find data here, but also tools and resources that would help you with your market research, or in building a new web, or mobile apps targeting a specific audience. Here are the topics that are covered-
		For Agriculture, Climate, Consumer, Ecosystems, Education, Energy, Finance, Health, Local Government, Manufacturing, Maritime, Ocean, Public Safety, Science & Research
		https://www.data.gov/
	NCES – National Center for Education Statistics. Education is an extremely important aspect of society and since new policies are debated about every year, it’s important to have data at hand to make sure that all decisions are data-driven. Even companies working on solutions to help improve children’s education can use the data to design better solutions. For such data sources, the NCES (National Center for Education Statistics) has a huge repository.
		https://nces.ed.gov/
	Labeled Faces in the Wild – Facial recognition is one of the top technologies in development today. It has found many uses. It does away with the need for manual check-in at airports. It helps the police track down, dangerous criminals. It is even being put to use to track the social life of citizens in China. Much of the work is based on creating algorithms and then training them on millions of faces and hoping that the next time a new face comes, the system should be able to recognize it as a completely new face and accordingly save it in its system. Getting facial data of so many people is not so easy and hence, if you are a hobbyist writing code to build models on facial data, the “Labeled Faces of the World” repository hosted by the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, contains more than 13,000 images of people, collected from the web.
		http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/
	Visual Genome – Identifying objects in images is something that people have been doing for years. However identifying multiple objects, such as a human being and a motorbike and then finding the association between them is something that has not been successfully done before. For finding such association in images and training new algorithms, the Visual Genome project has created a repository with:
		108,077 Images, 5.4 Million Region Descriptions, 1.7 Million Visual Question Answers, 3.8 Million Object Instances, 2.8 Million Attributes, 2.3 Million Relationships
		https://visualgenome.org/
	xView – xView is one of the largest public datasets of overhead imagery. It contains different types of terrains and locations around the world, annotated using bounding boxes. xView data also comes with a pre-trained baseline model, that has been created using TensorFlow object detection API, and it also contains an implementation using Pytorch. What this means is that when you are training a model to train on xView dataset, you can compare its efficiency with the pre-trained model to understand if you have done any better.
		https://xviewdataset.org/#dataset
	World Bank – The world bank is known to be the biggest monetary organization in the world. However, its databank is also one of the largest repositories of financial data of countries around the world. The data can be used by corporates wanting to expand to new regions or by researchers who want to study different financial datasets of places around the world.
		https://databank.worldbank.org/home.aspx
	Quandl – If you are looking for data on corporations or market research, Quandl is the best place to look. They describe themselves as the best source for “financial, economic, and alternative datasets, serving investment professionals”. They have different dataset options for different types of clients- Core financial data for everyone and Alternative datasets for Institutional Clients. Datasets range from End of the day US stock prices to Company hiring activity.
