REF: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/intro-to-site-reliability-engineering/1-introduction

# Core principles

- Appropriate levels of reliability
  Is there something we should do if we are successful at meeting or surpassing that level? Similarly, what if we don’t achieve it?
- How is SRE different from DevOps
  Diff: Implementation vs. cultural movement
  Same: monitoring/observibility and automation
- Virtuous cycle
  - SLIs and SLOs, and error budget
  - Blameless postmortems
- Toil
  SREs hate toil
