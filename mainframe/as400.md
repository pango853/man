- 実は90年代半ばには既に「AS/400は近いうちになくなる」と言われていたんです。それから20年以上、まだまだ健在ですからね。
	- OSの互換性が高いので、古いプログラムが動くんですよね。20年以上前に作ったプログラムがほぼ直さず動いている事例も複数知っています。

- Everything is an `Object`, not `file`
	- similar with objects in OOP - when storage is allocated for something, that something is of a specific type, and only a specific set of programs are allowed to act upon that object. However, AS/400 objects cannot be inherited like the classes in its languages(C++/Java)
	- For ownership, can set user profile and group profile for data sharing
	- object type is a three to six character mnemonic preceded by an asterisk. 
		*LIB: Library
			*PGM: Program (for compiled languages: CL, RPG-IV, C, C++, COBOL, etc. and there are no interface restrictions between the languages).
			*MODULE: Module (linkable into a program from a compiled language above and here too there are no restrictions on linkability between languages).
			*SRVPGM: Service program (dynamic set of one or more modules, akin to a DLL file in Microsoft Windows).
			*BNDDIR: Binding directory (holds a list of modules and service programs and is used when creating programs).
			*CMD: Command (an object used for calling programs that allows users to prompt for their parameters; can be created with the Command Definition language). See AS/400 Control Language for more information.
			*MENU: Menu (accessed with the GO command).
			*FILE: File (AS/400 files can be used for data, input/output devices, and source code, depending on sub type).
			*DTAARA: Data area (small bits of storage used to store tiny items of data for fast access).
			*JRN & *JRNRCV: Journal and journal receiver (used to journal changes to files, data areas, and stream files).
			*USRPRF: User profile (allows users to sign-on to the system).
			*JOBD: Job description (used when submitting/starting jobs).
			*SBSD: Subsystem description (used when starting subsystems; this is the place where user jobs run).
			*JOBQ: Job queue (used to queue up batch jobs to run in a subsystem).
			*LIND: Line description (communications line: Ethernet, token ring, etc.).
			*CTLD: Controller description (communications controller for lines, workstations, etc.).
			*DEVD: Device description (communications device for lines, workstations, printers tape drives, etc.)
			*DTAQ: Data queue (used to queue up data entries for fast retrieval by other jobs).
			*MSGQ: Message queue (used to send message to users, can also be used like a data queue).
			*OUTQ: Output queue (used to queue up output to a printer).
			*USRSPC: User space – a generic data-containing object of arbitrary size (up to 16T).
		*DIR: Directory
		*STMF: Stream file


- WRKACT-JOB
	For whether or not a batch job has finished, a user has signed off, or a subsystem has ended, etc.
	https://www.mcpressonline.com/it-infrastructure/it-infrastructure-other/wrkactjob-the-as400s-information-center
	- Parameters: enter WRKACTJOB on the command line and press the F4 key. Then, press F10 to display all the parameters.
		PRINT
		RESET	Reset job statistics like performance
		SBS		WRKACTJOB SBS(QSYSWRK), WRKACTJOB SBS(QSYSWRK QINTER QBATCH)
		RSPLMT	Response time limit
		CPU-PCTLMT	CPU percent limit
		SEQ		SEQ(*STS)
		JOB		Job name. JOB(QPADEV*)
		INTERVAL
	- Help: place cursor on the column name and press F1
	- F7 to find and F8 to repeat
	- automatic refresh: Set interval and press F19 to start
	- A status of MSGW (message wait) means that the job has a message that needs a response. -> “runaway” jobs that do nothing but drain your machine’s resources.
	- When relying on the WRKACTJOB display for CPU percentage, it is important to use F10 throughout the day to restart the statistics.

# Commands
STRPDM
WRKLIBPDM	Work with libraries
WRKOBJPDM	Work with objects

# Operations Tips
- WRKACTJOB を実行し、画面カーソルを「CPU %」カラムに移動し、Shift+F4 を押してジョブを CPU 使用率の降順にソートします
- WRKACTJOB - Status Codes: Put your cursor in the Status column and then press F1. The online help lists all status codes and their meanings. If you want to print the list, press F2 then F14. 
- WRKACTJOBコマンドで活動JOBの一覧を表示させ、その後に F10キーを連打することでRefresh
- 自動再表示間隔(INTERVAL): WRKACTJOBの追加オプションには、「自動再表示間隔」というパラメータがあるとのことでした -> WRKACTJOB SBS(QUSRWRK) INTERVAL(5)	注意：どうやら「F19キー」を打鍵しなければ、自動最新表示が開始されないようです。（再度、F19キーを押すと、自動最新表示機能が解除されます。）
- Check that you have the Admin web server running; there should be a series of ADMIN jobs in subsystem QHTTPSVR. If not, then you can start it with STRTCPSVR SERVER(*HTTP) HTTPSVR(*ADMIN). Then point your browser to the IP address of your server with port 2001, ie http://YourServerIP:2001. You should get a log in screen and from there the fun begins.

AS/400 Quick Command List
Command Grouping Menus
The VERB and SUBJECT menus are part of what are called the Command Grouping Menus. For every Three (or four) Letter Acronym there is a menu devoted to it that starts with the letters CMD. So to see all CHG commands the user would execute the command GO CMDCHG. For program commands the menu would be CMDPGM.
There are other menus besides the Command Grouping Menus. The starting point for the menuing system can be accessed by pressing F4 on an empty command line.
Note: This starts the Command Line Screen. On the OS/400 command line, type the following:

CALL QCMD              Press the Enter key.

To exit the Command Line Screen, press the F12 function key.
